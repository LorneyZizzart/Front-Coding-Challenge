# Front Coding Challenge

## Overview

Your main goal is to create a 11 question quiz, with true or false answers in the technology you are applying to work in. 
**You should not just implement the most basic solution. This is a chance to show off your abilities and impress.**

## How to deliver the challenge
Please create a code repository and send a public link to juan.lopez@mocionsoft.com
with: ###CodeChallenge [jobOfer] email subject thats It.
Estimated time to complete the challenge is one day.

**The final result code will be reviewed agains:**

- Functionality
- Code Format
- Project Structure
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Use of best practices
- State management
- Side effects handling
- Documentation

## Goals

Implement the screens based off the wireframes and api below. Note that the wireframes may not be complete, so use your best judgment for UI/UX implementation. **Do not use a boilerplate like React Boilerplate or Ignite for this challenge.** We want to see how you structure your project and what tooling you use from scratch. Create react app is fine to use. React Native projects should use the Expo CLI workflow: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started
